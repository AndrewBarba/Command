Command is a micro Swift Package that provides utilities for running system processes. We extracted it from Tuist to make it available for other projects that might need to run system processes.

## Motivation

Given that `Foundation.Process` exists, you might be wondering why we created this package. There are several reasons:

- We integrate with [swift-log](https://github.com/apple/swift-log) to log debug information about the commands that are being run.
- We provide a more user-friendly API that makes it easier to run commands.
- We align the API with Swift's structured concurrency model, making it easier to run commands concurrently.
- We provide better error handling, making it easier to understand what went wrong when running a command.

## Development

### Using Tuist

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/tuist/Command.git`
2. Generate the project: `tuist generate`


### Using Swift Package Manager

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/tuist/Command.git`
2. Open the `Package.swift` with Xcode
